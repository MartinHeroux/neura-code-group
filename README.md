# neura-code-group

## PART 1

* With the group leader driving (i.e., them sharing the screen)
* Clone repo to own computer (show the green button, and how you can download code or clone code)
  * run `git remote -v`  
* Create a branch called: 
 * 'remove_mean' (JO) 
 * 'remove_offset' (GEORGIA) 
 * 'normalize_to_100' (MARTY)
* Checkout that branch and add a function that adds the given functionality to the code in your module
* from your branch, add and commit your changes
* Next, from your branch, push your changes (use 'git push' and see what it says)
* Come back to GitHub, initiate a pull request based on your changes
* Reviewer your changes, demonstrate how you can leave comments/questions in code
* Go back to your machine, and, on your branch, add a doc string to your function
* Commit and push the changes
* Go back to GitHub, show how the new docstring is part of the pull request 
* Agree to merge the pull request

## PART 2 (if time; based on section 7.9 of online book Research Software Engineering with Python)

* The leader is to create a new repo; include a README.md with everones name listed on separate lines
* Have each group member fork the repo
* Have them clone the repo, make a branch, open the README.md and add their email beside their name
* Have them add, commit and push their changes (from the branch they created)
* Have them go to GitHub and make a pull request (might be good to have a group member sharing screen at this point)
* Then go to origin upstream (group leader's repo) and see pull request
* Have leader comment on one of the pull requests, get a reply, then accept the pull request
